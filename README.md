# GWInSpect

**GWInSpect** (Gravitational-Wave Inflation Spectrum) is a lightweight, single-file Python module for computing and visualizing the **spectral energy density of primordial gravitational waves** generated during the **inflationâ€“reheating** transition.  

It also provides quick utilities to check **BBN constraints** and visualize multi-epoch reheating scenarios.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Compute the gravitational-wave spectrum `Î©_GW(f)` for arbitrary reheating histories  
- Handle multiple equation-of-state (EoS) epochs  
- Check Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) constraints via  
  - `piecewise` (recommended)  
  - `intersection`  
  - `weaker`  
- Minimal dependencies (`numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`)  
- Simple to import â€” just one Python file!
